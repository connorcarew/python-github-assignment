Description
This code begins by welcoming the user, then promts the user to enter their name and the number of cats they have patted that day. Based on that number, an inference is made based on the daily total that the annual number of cats patted is the daily total multiplied by 365. This code churns out an answer for the approximate number of cats patted in a year based on the total of the given day.
